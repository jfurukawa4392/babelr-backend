# Babelr

Babelr is a single page native application written with React Native and Django. It uses the Google translate API to allow users to select a primary language and chat with other users with a streamlined translation experience. Now business partners, friends, and relatives can communicate in their native tongues and not miss an idiomatic beat.

## Architecture
The backend API was built using Django that serves requests from the mobile app which was built using React Native. It uses a token authentication system so the device can indefinitely access a valid, secure session.

Further iterations will include a desktop app, possibly written using vanilla React/Redux in the Electron native development technology.
